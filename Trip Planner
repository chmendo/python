# In this project, I am creating a trip planner using funtions with multiple parameters

# welcome message

trip_planner_welcome("Pan")

# time
def estimated_time_rounded(estimated_time):
  rounded_time = round(estimated_time)
  return rounded_time

estimate = estimated_time_rounded(1.0)

# generate messages for user's planned trip
def destination_setup(origin, destination, estimated_time, mode_of_transport="Car"):
  print("Your trip starts off in " + origin)
  print("And you are traveling to " + destination)
  print("You will be traveling by " + mode_of_transport)
  print("It will take approximately " + str(estimated_time) + " hours")

destination_setup("Haji Lane", "Jurong Bird Park", estimate)


# output should be:
